# Revenant Theme

Ian's personal Ghost theme!

Features:

- Minimalist, like the Revenant soundtrack.
- White, like the winter landscape in the Revenant.
- Safe, no sign of Tom Hardy or his scalp.
- 33% more comfortable than Leonardo DiCaprio's fur coat.
- 300% faster than Leonardo DiCaprio's journey back to Fort Kiowa.

More information coming soon.
